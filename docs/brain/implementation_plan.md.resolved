# Professional Agency UI Overhaul Plan

Elevate the Ark Engine website from a "tech-demo" aesthetic to a "Professional Agency" powerhouse. The goal is to balance futuristic innovation with corporate elegance, reliability, and visual depth.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This overhaul will introduce more structured layouts and a more sophisticated color palette (Deep Navy/Slate accents) to replace the high-contrast monochromatic look. I will also be reducing the size of the massive "9xl" headers for better professional hierarchy.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] Global Design System

#### [MODIFY] [index.css](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/index.css)
- Implement a "Secondary Dark" color (`#0a0b10`) to provide depth behind the pure black.
- Soften global borders (replace `white/10` with more nuanced `white/5` and `white/8` combinations).
- Refine the `glass` utility for better legibility (more blur, less opacity).

### [Component Name] Page-Specific Redesign

#### [MODIFY] [Home.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Home.tsx)
- Redesign the Hero section with a more structured "Feature Grid" or "Mission Statement" layout.
- Use `generate_image` to create a high-end "Abstract Tech Core" hero image to break the text-only monotony.
- Refine the CTA buttons with subtle glows and better transition easing.

#### [MODIFY] [Services.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Services.tsx)
- Expand the card layout for better "breathability".
- Use a more professional typography hierarchy (smaller labels, clearer body text).

#### [MODIFY] [Contact.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Contact.tsx)
- Clean up the form fields to feel like a high-end CRM portal.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
- **Visual Audit**: Ensure the typography hierarchy feels balanced across all screen sizes.
- **Aesthetic Check**: Confirm the move to slate/navy accents creates more visual depth.
- **Image Integration**: Verify that new generated assets load correctly and match the brand theme.
