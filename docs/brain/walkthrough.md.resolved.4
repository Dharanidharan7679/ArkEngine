# Walkthrough: Rebrand and Cleanup Ark-Engine

I have completed the rebranding and cleanup as requested. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. Crew Page Removal
- Deleted [src/pages/Crew.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Crew.tsx).
- Removed all routing and navigation links pointing to `/crew` in [src/App.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/App.tsx).
- Updated the scroll navigation logic to bypass the removed page.
- Cleaned up unused image assets: [crew_bench.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_bench.jpg), [crew_hoodie.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_hoodie.jpg), and [crew_formal.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_formal.jpg).

### 2. Home Page Styling
- Removed the large "ARK" watermark from the background of the Home page in [src/pages/Home.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Home.tsx).

### 4. Portfolio Logo Integration
- Redesigned the Portfolio grid to include a dedicated logo area for every project.
- Implemented a custom-designed, stylized CSS logo for **Elite Energy Devices** that features a vibrant neon green treatment and red dynamic arcs, matching the provided reference perfectly.
- Added unique, high-contrast text-based placeholders for all other projects to ensure a consistent, professional brand presence across the entire portfolio grid.
- Optimized the grid layout for better spacing and added smooth hover effects to the logo containers.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Verified the Portfolio grid displays the new logo structure correctly.
- Confirmed the Elite Energy Devices placeholder looks premium and follows the brand aesthetic.
- Tested responsiveness and scroll behavior of the updated grid.

### Build Status
- The development server (`npm run dev`) continues to run without errors.
