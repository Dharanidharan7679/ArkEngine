# Walkthrough: Rebrand and Cleanup Ark-Engine

I have completed the rebranding and cleanup as requested. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. Crew Page Removal
- Deleted [src/pages/Crew.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Crew.tsx).
- Removed all routing and navigation links pointing to `/crew` in [src/App.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/App.tsx).
- Updated the scroll navigation logic to bypass the removed page.
- Cleaned up unused image assets: `crew_bench.jpg`, `crew_hoodie.jpg`, and `crew_formal.jpg`.

### 2. Home Page Styling
- Removed the large "ARK" watermark from the background of the Home page in [src/pages/Home.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Home.tsx).

### 3. Floating Founder Credit
- Implemented a premium, animated floating square box at the bottom center of the screen.
- The box features a subtle "floating" vertical animation using `framer-motion`.
- Inside the box, the word **FOUNDER** is highlighted with a background treatment, and the name **DHARMA** is positioned elegantly below it.
- This global credit replaces the static text-based footer, ensuring a unique and consistent brand identity across all pages.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- Navigated through the site using the menu and scroll wheel; the "Crew" section is completely gone, and the flow is seamless.
- Confirmed the Home page background is now clean without the "ARK" text.
- Verified the footer consistently displays the founder's name on all pages.

### Build Status
- The development server (`npm run dev`) continues to run without errors.
