# EmailJS Integration Plan

Integrate EmailJS into the [Contact](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Contact.tsx#6-200) page to enable real email submissions from the contact form.

## User Review Required

> [!IMPORTANT]
> I need your **Template ID** to finalize the integration. You provided the Public Key and Service ID, but the Template ID is also required to send the email. I will use a placeholder `YOUR_TEMPLATE_ID` for now.

## Proposed Changes

### [Component Name] EmailJS Integration

#### [NEW] Dependency
- Install `@emailjs/browser` via npm.

#### [MODIFY] [Contact.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Contact.tsx)
- Import `emailjs` from `@emailjs/browser`.
- Initialize `emailjs` in a `useEffect` hook using the provided Public Key.
- Update the form to use `useRef` for the form element.
- Implement the `sendEmail` function to trigger `emailjs.sendForm`.
- Add state for handling "Sending...", "Success", and "Error" messages.
- Ensure form inputs have `name` attributes (e.g., `user_name`, `user_email`, `message`).

## Verification Plan

### Automated Tests
- N/A (requires manual form submission check).

### Manual Verification
- Fill out the contact form and click "Submit".
- Verify that "Sending..." state appears.
- Verify that a success message appears after submission.
- User should check their EmailJS dashboard/inbox to confirm receipt.
