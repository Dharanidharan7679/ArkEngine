# Walkthrough: Rebrand and Cleanup Ark-Engine

I have completed the rebranding and cleanup as requested. Here's a summary of the changes:

## Changes Made

### 1. Crew Page Removal
- Deleted [src/pages/Crew.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Crew.tsx).
- Removed all routing and navigation links pointing to `/crew` in [src/App.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/App.tsx).
- Updated the scroll navigation logic to bypass the removed page.
- Cleaned up unused image assets: [crew_bench.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_bench.jpg), [crew_hoodie.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_hoodie.jpg), and [crew_formal.jpg](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/assets/crew_formal.jpg).

### 2. Home Page Styling
- Removed the large "ARK" watermark from the background of the Home page in [src/pages/Home.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/pages/Home.tsx).

### 3. Contact-Specific Founder Credit
- Moved the animated founder box from the global [App.tsx](file:///d:/Ark-Engine/src/App.tsx) layout to the **Contact** page specifically.
- The box now appears in the center at the bottom of the contact form section, adding a unique and personalized touch to the final part of the user journey.
- It retains its premium 240x240px size, company logo integration, and smooth floating animation.

### 5. The "Final 5%" Polish
- **Unique CSS Logo Grid**: Every project in the Portfolio now has a hand-crafted CSS logo. From the pulsating waves of "PulseWave Corp" to the medical red-cross of "Kongu Blood Bank," the grid looks alive and professional.
- **Ark Protocol Boot Sequence**: Implemented a 2.5-second cinematic loading screen that displays "diagnostic data" while the site initializes, drastically improving the premium feel.
- **Professional Content**: Rebranded the contact location to "Global Grid Hub // India" and integrated the external "Ark AI" portal link.
- **KGF Holidays Logo**: Successfully integrated the actual company logo for KGF Holidays, replacing the placeholder and updating its project timeline to 2026.
- **UX Finalization**: Resolved all JSX linting issues and perfected the layout of the Contact page specifically.

## Verification Results

### Manual Verification
- **Portfolio**: Confirmed each logo animates or displays its unique theme correctly.
- **Boot Sequence**: Verified the loading bar and text diagnostic work seamlessly on first load.
- **Responsive Check**: Tested the new logos and contact layout on mobile and desktop viewports.

### Build Status
- The development server (`npm run dev`) continues to run without errors.
